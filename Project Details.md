Heyy team! 👋 Hope you're all doing well.

Excited to officially kick off our project: "SentiMind". This is going to be a fantastic journey into Natural Language Processing, and I'm really looking forward to guiding you through it. The git repository will essentially be used to upload the reference files necessary for your better understanding.

You can find all the web resources for the project here:
